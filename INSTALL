			    INSTALLING

Consult INSTALL file for generic instructions about installing.

Simple installation process could look like this:

# make install

Before "make install" you can use "make strip" like there:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make strip
# make install

  Linux Debian 2.2
  Linux Debian 3.0
  Linux RedHat 7.3
  Linux RedHat 9.0
  NetBSD 1.5
  OpenBSD 3.2

Probably on the most UNIX systems shouldn't be any problems. If so, write

 in the "Subject:" field.
